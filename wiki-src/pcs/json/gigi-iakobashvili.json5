Demonstrated capacity to manipulate digital systems, perception, and low-level probability, often under the cover of “hacker” subculture and student status. Known or suspected ties to think-tank/front organization <strong>GROUP 3³</strong>, with indications of shared research into altered cognition and consensus fragility. Threat assessment: <strong class='threat-assessment'>AMBER</strong> for information security and memetic stability; subject's improvisational behavior complicates prediction models.",
