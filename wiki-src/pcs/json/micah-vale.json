Symbiote enables full-body mass conversion and multiple secondary combat adaptations; entity displays independent cognition and overt predatory affect while remaining highly protective of host. Subject favors vertical terrain, ambush, and rapid exfiltration, using the symbiote as both shock weapon and intimidation tool. Threat assessment: <strong class='threat-assessment'>EMBER</strong> in dense urban environments; control vectors likely limited to emotional leverage on host.",
