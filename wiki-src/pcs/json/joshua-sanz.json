He can also run afoul of low-tech physical security like trip wires or covered pit traps.{{SOURCE:DtR/115}}</li> </ul> </div> <div class='sub-block'> <h3>Variation: Out of Phase ••••</h3> <h4><strong>Keywords:</strong> Overt, Tiered, Toggled</h4> <p> Raúl's body does not interact with matter in the ordinary way. Raúl may render his body insubstantial, in part or as a whole, including any clothing or equipment, as long as they consist entirely of materials whose Durability is less than <strong>3</strong>. His insubstantial body parts can pass through material up to a Durability of <strong>3</strong>: Only rare, super-hard or mystical substances are beyond his ability to penetrate.</p> <ul> <li>This can likewise afford him the benefits of partial concealment against weapons of a Durability low enough to not interact with his body.</li> <li>His entire body remains insubstantial until the end of the scene or until he ends the Variation as an instant action. He therefore can’t reach into an enemy’s chest and crush her heart in a fist, for example. However, by limiting his insubstantiality to a lesser Durability, he could reach through a wooden door to unlock it from the other side using the metal doorknob, since it would still be solid to his hand.</li> <li>He must decide how insubstantial to make himself at the time he activates the Variation (i.e. whether <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, or <strong>3</strong>), but he can change this density as an instant action during its duration.</li> <li>He can leave behind immaterial objects, which become material again when he does.</li> <li>Insubstantial items that intersect with other objects when the Variation ends are ejected from them into the nearest empty space large enough to accommodate them, inflicting a minor Instability on Raúl.</li><li>If this Variation ends while Raúl still intersects a solid object, he is ejected from it and suffers a medium Instability.{{SOURCE:DtR/126}}</li> </ul> </div>"
