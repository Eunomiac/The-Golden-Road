      "power": "{{NAME}} can feed or starve an electronic device, powering it on or off even in the absence of a viable power source. This can “hotwire” a device that usually requires a physical component, such as a switch, button, lever, or ignition. If the device controls other devices (such as a control terminal that directs an entire assembly line of robots, or the ignition of a car that is otherwise in operational condition), it is possible to control much larger machinery, as long as the subordinate devices have an existing power source.",
