    /* Add the system data that, after being processed & compiled, will be passed to the Handlebars template, which will enable generating the Trait Tag icons (used to designate, e.g., Asset Skills or Variation targets). We need to:

    1. Generate a <size>x<size>px element containing a `.webp` icon file defined here
    2. Identify its immediate sibling as the "tagged element"
    3. Place the element immediately to the left of its next sibling, with a configurable gap; if a stacking context is required, ensure or enforce working isolation of the tagged element and its icon
    4. Apply the "tagged-trait" CSS class to the tagged element
    5. Include a tooltip, using the same logic as our curly notation "{{TOOLTIP}}" handler.
          5.a. Set up the icon element itself as the tooltip anchor
          5.b. Define the tooltip contents here, as, e.g., "tooltipTitle", "tooltipSubtitle", "tooltipBody", "tooltipCitation", then assemble into a tooltip HTML string by the parser and applied to the template
          5.c. Ensure placement, tags, classes and attributes of tooltip-related elements are correct (see {{TOOLTIP}} handler for examples)
    6. Identify when and how to apply these changes to the output: during, or after the processing of curly notations?
